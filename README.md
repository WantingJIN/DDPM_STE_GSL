# Data-driven plume model with source term estimation for gas source localization with gas sensing robots

This is the implementation of the robot controller tested with Webots 2021b for the project of data-driven plume model for gas source localization. To use the gas dispersion plugin in Webots, please find the plugin with a test world composed of a sensor(gas and wind sensor) network in the repository: https://github.com/WantingJIN/Webots_odor_plugin
